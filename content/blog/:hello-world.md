I got rid of my old website I created in Jekyll two years ago, primarily because I forgot everything about ruby that I had learned in a couple of days to make that website. After a whole lot of procrastinating, I decided to try the new website in Hugo. I chose a pretty [simple theme](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/) and I intend to modify it to create something of my own.

I don't really have a niche so I will talk about everything I can: earthquakes, math, music production and guitar stuff, or tech stuff.I am trying to start blogging more seriously and I have just started using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write stuff (literally whatever I do) daily, and then try to churn out some coherent content out of those notes. I'll talk about it in a later post once I have a better grasp on how to integrate it into my workflow.

Feel free to look around and bookmark anything you like. Also, don't hesitate to comment or contact me with any questions you have.

Peace,
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
