I got rid of my old website I created in Jekyll two years ago, primarily because I hadn't updated that in a while and I forgot everything about ruby that I had learned in a couple of days to make that website. After a whole lot of procrastinating, I decided to try the new website in Hugo. I chose a pretty [simple theme](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/) and I intend to modify it to create something of my own.

I also want to start blogging more seriously so feel free to look around and bookmark anything you like. Also, don't hesitate to comment or contact me with any questions you have.
