I am a PhD student at University of Michigan working  with [Yihe Huang](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/yihehuang/). My current research is numerical modeling of earthquake cycles for strike-slip fault systems. In simple terms, I am simulating multiple earthquakes over long period of time (~2000 years) for systems like San Andreas Fault. I am interested in understanding how the material and frictional properties of the fault rock influence the earthquake cycles. 

I come from Mumbai, India, where I spent most of my childhood. I completed my undergraduate in 2016 from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, majoring in Geology. Later, I spent one year at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore as a teaching assistant before joining the PhD program at UMich in 2017.


Apart from research, I am interested in music, and I play guitar as a hobby. I am also interested in webcomics and art. I will write about a variety of things here, including my ongoing research, some music projects, travel, and food. Feel free to keep an eye on my project updates and bookmark anything you find interesting.
