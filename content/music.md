description: My music projects.
---

I started out as an amateur bedroom guitarist in high school and now I'm getting a little more into audio recording and music production, still in the bedroom. Unlike the typical spare bedroom music studio, my bedroom studio is my actual bedroom where I sleep and make music, and also work (during covid).

I am trying to learn Bass, Synth (MIDI), and music production (Ableton) these days.

Here are some of my amateur(ish) incomplete demos (original compositions):

1. https://soundcloud.com/thehalfspace/geodetic-feels

2. https://soundcloud.com/thehalfspace/cocoaweed

3. https://soundcloud.com/thehalfspace/solitary-waves


Here are some collaborations I did on reddit and discord (If you liked these, show some love to my collaborators as well by following/liking/etc):

1. A synth-pop Christmas themed composition: https://soundcloud.com/twotimessomething/where-did-the-season-go-ft-germyp-thehalfspace

2. A Doo Wop Christmas themed composition:
