<p><b>What I am doing now:</b> I am a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan working with <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/yihehuang/">Yihe Huang</a>. I simulate earthquakes on a computer to understand the effects of the nearby (fault-zone) structure on long-term (think 1000s of years) earthquake sequences.</p>

<p> In my free time, I'm polishing my hobby: Guitars, Bass, Music Production, and Audio Editing. More recently, I'm also dipping my toes into Video and Image editing.</p>
